I built two kinds of Donald Trump Speech Generator.
trumpspeechgenerator1 generates speech from scratch, however, the result might be very incohesive and meaningless.
trumpspeechgenerator2 is much better, I generate new speech by replacing the verb and nouns in his old speech. 
I firstly categorized all the word choices trump used as verbs, nouns, adj, adv, then I randomly switched the words to generate new speeches.
