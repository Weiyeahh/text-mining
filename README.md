I built two kinds of Donald Trump Speech Generator.
trumpspeechgenerator generates speech from scratch, however, the result might be very incohesive and meaningless.
trumpspeechgenerator2 is much better, I generate new speech by replacing the verb and nouns in his old speech. 
I firstly categorized all the word choices trump used as verbs, nouns, adj, adv, then I randomly switched the words to generate new speeches. 
With more time given, I will experiment with GPT3 and learn more about creating meaningful speech. 

(I was also thinking about doing a sentimental map of the Ukraine situation, however, Twitter never granted me access to their level 2 API.)
